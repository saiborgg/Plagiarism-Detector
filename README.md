This project presents a Plagiarism Detection system using Natural Language Processing techniques to identify textual similarity between documents. Utilizing TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and cosine similarity for comparison, the model effectively detects potential plagiarism by quantifying the semantic closeness of text inputs. The notebook demonstrates preprocessing steps such as tokenization and stopword removal, followed by similarity computation and interpretation of results. This project is a practical application of classical NLP and machine learning techniques to address real-world academic integrity concerns.
